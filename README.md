# Fully-Connected Multi-Layer Perceptrons for Digits-Recognization

Welcome to my GitHub project, which marks the beginning of my journey in computer vision and reflects my passion for exploring the field. This project served as the foundation for my subsequent research in image classification.

To gain a deeper understanding of the optimization process in machine learning, including Forward-Propagation and Backward-Propagation, and how computers interpret images, I decided to construct a three-layer Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) network from scratch, using only the Numpy library. This custom-built MLP network aims to accomplish the task of handwritten digit recognition. The project encompasses various critical tasks, such as designing the MLP network architecture, initializing weights and biases, implementing diverse normalization methods for different types of image data, defining activation functions (tanh, softmax, relu), and, most importantly, understanding the entire process of Forward-Propagation and Backward-Propagation for training the network.

In addition to the core implementation, I introduce PyQt5, a versatile toolkit, to design a user-friendly interface for seamless interactions. The PyQt5 integration serves two main purposes:
